<h1>A Few Of My Favorites</h1>
<div class="row">
<h2>Vacation Destination</h2>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>My absolute favorite place to vacation is the Dominican Republic. I have only been twice, however it only took one trip for me to fall in love. Not only are the beaches beautiful and clear, but the people who live there are extremely polite. While I was there, my best friend, Lauren, and I got to zip-line through the forests, snorkel in the Carribean sea, swim with sharks, play with monkeys, and so much more. Not to mention the food is incredible. At both of the resorts we stayed at, there was a 24/7 buffet as well as plenty of restaurants on-site. I'll never forget the memories I have from such a beautiful place.</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>It's hard to pick just one memory as my favorite. If I had to choose one from this year it would be my 21st birthday party. This night was special to me because I got to spend the whole night surrounded by all of my best friends. My friends suprised me with a huge Kylie Jenner sign so that everyone knew that it was my birthday when we went downtown. It was very strange yet exciting to get so much attention all night. We ended our long night with a huge cake fight in our tiny apartment kitchen. It was definitely a night to remember. </p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>Music is a huge part of my life. I am almost always listening to music. I have no specific preference of genre, I listen to just about anything. I love going to concerts and music festivals. This year, my friends and I went to Music Midtown in Atlanta. The intense September heat mixed with our large group of friends made it pretty hectic at certain times. However, we still had an amazing time. When I was in high school, I was obsessed with a band called 5 Seconds of Summer. They're a young, pop-rock, austrailian band that is well known for playing their own instruments. I have met them three different times at meet and greets. My roommate and I even got to have dinner with them in downtown Atlanta one night. Since then, my obsession with them has died down but it was fun while it lasted.</p>
