<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Olivia Garrett, but I go by my middle name, Payton. I am a currently a junior majoring in computer science at Georgia College and State University. I graduated from Lambert High School in Suwanee Georgia in 2015 and plan to graduate from Georgia College in spring 2019. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends as well as working as a waitress at The Velvet Elvis in downtown Milledgeville. I am a part of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority on campus and I am the public relations representative for Women in Technology Club. My parents are currently living in Cumming, Georgia and my younger sister is going to school in Statesboro, Georgia. I live in a small, six-bedroom house with five of my best friends and our miniature dachsund, Winnie. Check out the rest of my website to learn even more about me!</p>
